\arguments{
\item{studyName}{Name identifying the set of study parameters.}

\item{targetCohortId}{Target cohort ID of current study settings.}

\item{eventCohortIds}{Event cohort IDs of current study settings.}

\item{includeTreatments}{Include treatments starting ('startDate') or ending ('endDate') after
target cohort start date.}

\item{periodPriorToIndex}{Number of days prior to the index date of the target cohort that event
cohorts are allowed to start.}

\item{minEraDuration}{Minimum time an event era should last to be included in analysis.}

\item{splitEventCohorts}{Specify event cohort ID's to split in acute (< X days) and therapy
(>= X days).}

\item{splitTime}{Specify number of days (X) at which each of the split event cohorts
should be split in acute and therapy.}

\item{eraCollapseSize}{Window of time between which two eras of the same event cohort are
collapsed into one era.}

\item{combinationWindow}{Window of time two event cohorts need to overlap to be considered a
combination treatment.}

\item{minPostCombinationDuration}{Minimum time an event era before or after a generated combination
treatment should last to be included in analysis.}

\item{filterTreatments}{Select first occurrence of ("First") / changes between ("Changes') / all
event cohorts ("All").}

\item{maxPathLength}{Maximum number of steps included in treatment pathway (max 5).}

\item{minCellCount}{Minimum number of persons with a specific treatment pathway for the
pathway to be included in analysis.}

\item{minCellMethod}{Select to completely remove / sequentially adjust (by removing last step
as often as necessary) treatment pathways below minCellCount.}

\item{groupCombinations}{Select to group all non-fixed combinations in one category 'otherâ€™ in
the sunburst plot.}

\item{addNoPaths}{Select to include untreated persons without treatment pathway in the
sunburst plot}
