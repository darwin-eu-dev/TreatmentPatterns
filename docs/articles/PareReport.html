<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity" class="external-link">Cyclomatic
Complexity</a> is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a
program. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly
independent paths through a programâ€™s source code. It was developed by
Thomas J. McCabe, Sr.Â in 1976.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And is calculated as follows: <span class="math inline">\(M = E - N +
2P\)</span></p>
<p>The complexity score is interpreted as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1-10 Simple procedure, little risk</li>
<li>11-20 More complex, moderate risk</li>
<li>21-50 Complex, high risk</li>
<li>&gt;50 Untestable code, very high risk</li>
</ul>
