## Pathway settings
The settings belowallow the user to influence how the events of interest should be processed to form treatment pathways. For the example in this vignette we used the default settings

| param | values | description |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| periodPriorToIndex | 0 | Number of days prior to the index date of the target cohort | that event cohorts are allowed to start |
| minEraDuration | 0 | Minimum time an event era should last to be included in analysis |
| splitEventCohorts |  | Specify event cohort to split in acute (< X days) and therapy (>= X days) |
| splitTime | 30 | Specify number of days (X) at which each of the split event cohorts should be split in acute and therapy |
| eraCollapseSize | 30 | Window of time between which two eras of the same event cohort are collapsed into one era |
| combinationWindow | 30 | Window of time two event cohorts need to overlap to be considered a combination treatment |
| minPostCombinationDuration | 30 | Minimum time an event era before or after a generated combination treatment should last to be included in analysis |
| filterTreatments | First | Select first occurrence of (‘First’); changes between (‘Changes’); or all event cohorts (‘All’). |
| maxPathLength | 5 | Maximum number of steps included in treatment pathway |
| minFreq | 5 | Minimum frequency required per pathway. Censors data below `x` as `<x`. This minimum value will carry over to the sankey diagram and sunburst plot. |
| addNoPaths | FALSE | Select to include untreated persons without treatment pathway in the sunburst plot |

```{r setupCohorts}
# Select Viral Sinusitis Cohort
targetCohorts <- cohortsGenerated %>%
  filter(cohortName == "ViralSinusitis") %>%
  select(cohortId, cohortName)

# Select everything BUT Viral Sinusitis cohorts
eventCohorts <- cohortsGenerated %>%
  filter(cohortName != "ViralSinusitis" & cohortName != "Death") %>%
  select(cohortId, cohortName)

exitCohorts <- cohortsGenerated %>%
  filter(cohortName == "Death") %>%
  select(cohortId, cohortName)

cohorts <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  targetCohorts %>% mutate(type = "target"),
  eventCohorts %>% mutate(type = "event"),
  exitCohorts %>% mutate(type = "exit")
)
```

## DatabaseConnector
### All-in-one
```{r warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
tempDir <- tempdir()
allDir <- file.path(tempDir, "all_in_one")

TreatmentPatterns::executeTreatmentPatterns(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "CohortTable",
  outputPath = allDir,
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmSchema = "main",
  resultSchema = "main",
  # Optional settings
  includeTreatments = "startDate",
  periodPriorToIndex = 0,
  minEraDuration = 0,
  splitEventCohorts = "",
  splitTime = 30,
  eraCollapseSize = 30,
  combinationWindow = 30,
  minPostCombinationDuration = 30,
  filterTreatments = "First",
  maxPathLength = 5,
  minFreq = 5,
  addNoPaths = TRUE
)
```

### Segmented
The segmented approach allows you to investigate the patient-level intermediate files by querying the andromeda environment.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
andromeda <- TreatmentPatterns::computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "CohortTable",
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmSchema = "main",
  resultSchema = "main"
)
```

```{r intermediateResults}
names(andromeda)
```

```{r treatmentHistory}
andromeda$treatmentHistory
```

The files inside the andromeda environment can be exported using the export function.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
segDir <- file.path(tempDir, "segmented")
TreatmentPatterns::export(andromeda, outputPath = segDir)
```

## CDMConnector
```{r eval=FALSE}
cdmDir <- file.path(tempDir, "CDMCon")

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), eunomia_dir())
cdm <- CDMConnector::cdm_from_con(
  con = con,
  cdm_schema = "main",
  write_schema = "main"
)

TreatmentPatterns::executeTreatmentPatterns(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "CohortTable",
  outputPath = cdmDir,
  cdm = cdm
)
```
