```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

withr::local_envvar(
  R_USER_CACHE_DIR = tempfile(),
  EUNOMIA_DATA_FOLDER = Sys.getenv("EUNOMIA_DATA_FOLDER", unset = tempfile())
)
```

In **1. Defining Cohorts** we discussed how to define and generate cohorts for `TreatmentPatterns`. In this section we assume you are able to generate a cohort table using either `CohortGenerator` or `CDMConnector`.

Lets generate our Viral Sinusitis dummy cohorts provided in `TreatmentPatterns` using `CDMConnector`.

## Generating Cohorts
First we need to read in our cohorts.
```{r readCohortSet}
library(CDMConnector)

cohortSet <- readCohortSet(
  path = system.file(package = "TreatmentPatterns", "exampleCohorts")
)

cohortSet
```

Then we can open a connection to our database, in this case Eunomia.
```{r setLocalEnvar, echo=FALSE}
# withr::local_envvar(
#   R_USER_CACHE_DIR = tempfile(),
#   .local_envir = testthat::teardown_env(),
#   EUNOMIA_DATA_FOLDER = Sys.getenv("EUNOMIA_DATA_FOLDER", unset = tempfile())
# )

if (require("Eunomia", character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
  CDMConnector::downloadEunomiaData(overwrite = TRUE)
}
```

```{r connectToCDM}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = duckdb::duckdb(),
  dbdir = eunomia_dir()
)

cdm <- cdmFromCon(
  con = con,
  cdmSchema = "main",
  writeSchema = "main"
)
cdm
```

Finally we can generate our cohort set as a cohort table into the database
```{r generateCohortSet}
cdm <- generateCohortSet(
  cdm = cdm,
  cohortSet = cohortSet,
  name = "cohort_table",
  overwrite = TRUE
)

cohortCount(cdm$cohort_table)
```

We can see that all our cohorts are generated in the cohort table. The cohort with _cohort_definition_id_ 5 has a count of 0, this is the _Death_ cohort. This is not detrimental, as exit cohorts are optional, but good to know that Death will not show up in our results.

## Computing pathways
The `computePathways` function of `TreatmentPatterns` allows us to compute treatment pathways in our cohort table. In order to do this we need to pre-specify some parameters.

According to the documentation we need a `data.frame` that specifies what cohort is of which type.

>Data frame containing the following columns and data types:
>
>cohortId numeric(1)
>Cohort ID's of the cohorts to be used in the cohort table.
>
>cohortName character(1)
>Cohort names of the cohorts to be used in the cohort table.
>
>type character(1) ["target", "event', "exit"]
>Cohort type, describing if the cohort is a target, event, or exit cohort

We are able to re-use our `cohortSet` for this. As it already contains the cohort ID's and cohort names. We only have to remove the `cohort` and `json` columns, add a `type` column, and rename `cohort_definition_id` to `cohortId` and `cohort_name` to `cohortName`.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

cohorts <- cohortSet %>%
  # Remove 'cohort' and 'json' columns
  select(-"cohort", -"json", -"cohort_name_snakecase") %>%
  mutate(type = c("event", "event", "event", "event", "exit", "event", "event", "target")) %>%
  rename(
    cohortId = "cohort_definition_id",
    cohortName = "cohort_name",
  )

cohorts
```

With our `data.frame` of cohort types, CDM reference, and the cohort table name in our database we can compute the treatment pathways, with all of the other settings as their defaults.
```{r computeWithDefaults}
library(TreatmentPatterns)

defaultSettings <- computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm
)

defaultSettings
```
The output of `computePathways` is an [Andromeda](https://ohdsi.github.io/Andromeda/) environment, which allows us to investigate intermediate results and patient-level data. **This data is not sharable.**

```{r outputTables}
# treatmentHistory table
head(defaultSettings$treatmentHistory)

# metadata table
defaultSettings$metadata

# First Recieved First Stopped
head(defaultSettings$addRowsFRFS_1)

# Last Recieved Last Stopped
head(defaultSettings$addRowsLRFS_1)
```
`DatabaseConnector` is also supported. The following parameters are required **instead** of `cdm`:

1. `connectionDetails`: ConnectionDetails object form [DatabaseConnector](https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/).
2. `cdmSchema`: Schema where the CDM exists.
3. `resultSchema`: Schema to write the cohort table to.
4. `tempEmulationSchema`: Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To emulate temp tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables can be created.

The following code snippet works with `Eunomia`, a cohort table (cohort_table) exists in the database, and a `cohorts` data frame has been created.
```{r DatabaseConnector, eval=FALSE}
computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = cohortTableName,
  connectionDetails = Eunomia::getEunomiaConnectionDetails(),
  cdmSchema = "main",
  resultSchema = "main",
  tempEmulationSchema = NULL
)
```


## Pathway settings
Even though the default settings work well for most use cases, it might not work for all situations. The settings below allow us to influence how the events of interest should be processed to form treatment pathways.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| periodPriorToIndex | 0 | Number of days prior to the index date of the target cohort that event cohorts are allowed to start |
| minEraDuration | 0 | Minimum time an event era should last to be included in analysis |
| eraCollapseSize | 30 | Window of time between which two eras of the same event cohort are collapsed into one era |
| combinationWindow | 30 | Window of time two event cohorts need to overlap to be considered a combination treatment |
| minPostCombinationDuration | 30 | Minimum time an event era before or after a generated combination treatment should last to be included in analysis |
| filterTreatments | First | Select first occurrence of (‘First’); changes between (‘Changes’); or all event cohorts (‘All’). |
| maxPathLength | 5 | Maximum number of steps included in treatment pathway |

The following figure shows how each of these parameters affect the computation of the treatment pathway.

![pathwaySettings](../man/figures/pathwaysettings.png)
You can add these settings to the `computePathways` function call. Lets see what happens when we set our `minEraDuration` to **60**, but keep the rest of the settings mentioned as their default values.
```{r pathwaySettings}
minEra60 <- computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm,
  # Pathway settings
  periodPriorToIndex = 0,
  minEraDuration = 60,
  eraCollapseSize = 30,
  combinationWindow = 30,
  minPostCombinationDuration = 30,
  filterTreatments = "First",
  maxPathLength = 5
)
```
Number of treatments with a minimum duration of greater or equal to 0 days.
```{r nDefault}
defaultSettings$treatmentHistory %>%
  collect() %>%
  nrow()
```
Number of treatments with a minimum duration of greater or equal to 60 days.
```{r nMinEra60}
minEra60$treatmentHistory %>%
  collect() %>%
  nrow()
```

### Acute and Therapy splits
We can also split our defined event cohorts into **acute** and **therapy** cohorts.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| splitEventCohorts | Specify event cohort ID's (i.e. `c(1, 2, 3)` to split in acute (< splitTime days) and therapy (>= splitTime days). As an example treatment **Drug A** could be split into **Drug A (therapy)** and **Drug A (acute)**. And we could set our splitTime to _30_. **Drug A (acute)** would be the time before day 0-29 and **Drug A (therapy)** would be the day 30 or later. |
| splitTime | Specify number of days at which each of the split event cohorts should be split in acute and therapy (i.e. `c(20, 30, 10)`). The length of `splitTime` must equal the length of `splitEventCohorts` |

Let's say we want to assume that the first 60 days of our treatment is acute, and beyond that therapy.
```{r splitEventCohorts, warning=FALSE}
splitAcuteTherapy <- computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm,
  # Split settings
  splitEventCohorts = 1,
  splitTime = 60
)

splitAcuteTherapy$treatmentHistory %>%
  pull(.data$eventCohortName) %>% unique()
```
We can see that our Acetaminophen cohorts are split into Acetaminophen **(acute)** and **(therapy)**. _Acute_ labels all the Acetaminophen cohorts lasting less than our defined `splitTime`, in this case 60 days. _Therapy_ labels all the Acetaminophen cohorts lasting 60 days or more.

### Include treatments in a time frame
We can dictate in what time frame we want to look. We can look from the start date of our target cohort and on wards, or we can look before the end date of our target cohort. By default `TreatmentPatterns` looks from the start date and onwards.

```{r includeTreatments}
includeEndDate <- computePathways(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  cdm = cdm,
  # Split settings
  includeTreatments = "endDate"
)

identical(
  includeEndDate$treatmentHistory %>% pull(personId),
  defaultSettings$treatmentHistory %>% pull(personId)
)
```
In our example case for Viral Sinusitis it appears to not matter, as the personID's are identical.

## Exporting result objects
The `export` function allows us to export the generated result objects from `computePathways`. There are several arguments that we can change to alter the behavior, depending on what we are allowed to share.

### minCellCount and censorType
Let's say we are only able to share results of groups of subjects that have at least 5 subjects in them.
```{r minCellCount}
tempDir <- tempdir()

export(
  andromeda = defaultSettings,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "default"),
  minCellCount = 5
)
```

We can also choose between different methods how to handle pathways that fall below are specified `minCellCount`. These types are **1**) `"cellCount"`, **2**) `"remove"`, and **3**) `"mean"`.

We could say we want to censor all pathways that fall below the `minCellCount` to be censored _to_ the `minCellCount`.
```{r censorType_cellCount}
export(
  andromeda = minEra60,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "minEra60_cellCount"),
  minCellCount = 5,
  censorType = "minCellCount"
)
```

Or we could completely remove them
```{r censorType_remove}
export(
  andromeda = minEra60,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "minEra60_remove"),
  minCellCount = 5,
  censorType = "remove"
)
```

Or finally we can censor them as the mean of all the groups that fall below the `minCellCount`.
```{r censorType_mean}
export(
  andromeda = minEra60,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "minEra60_mean"),
  minCellCount = 5,
  censorType = "mean"
)
```

### ageWindow
We can also specify an age window.
```{r ageWindow3}
export(
  andromeda = splitAcuteTherapy,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "splitAcuteTherapy_ageWindow3"),
  minCellCount = 5,
  censorType = "mean",
  ageWindow = 3
)
```

Or a collection of ages.
```{r ageWindowMultiple}
export(
  andromeda = splitAcuteTherapy,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "splitAcuteTherapy_ageWindowMultiple"),
  minCellCount = 5,
  censorType = "mean",
  ageWindow = c(0, 18, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 150)
)
```

### archiveName
Finally we can also specify an `archiveName` which is the name of a zip-file to zip all our output csv-files to.
```{r archiveName}
export(
  andromeda = includeEndDate,
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "includeEndDate"),
  minCellCount = 5,
  censorType = "mean",
  ageWindow = 3,
  archiveName = "output.zip"
)
```
## All-in-one
Instead of using `computePathways` and `export`, instead we could use `executeTreatmentPatterns`. Which is an all-in-one function that trades full control for convenience.
```{r executeTreatmentPatternsCDMConnector}
executeTreatmentPatterns(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "all-in-one"),
  cdm = cdm,
  minEraDuration = 0,
  eraCollapseSize = 30,
  combinationWindow = 30,
  minCellCount = 5
)
```

When using `DatabaseConnector` we can substitute the `cdm` object with `connectionDetails`, `cdmSchema`, `resultSchema`, and `tempEmulationSchema`.
```{r executeTreatmentPatternsDatabaseConnector, eval=FALSE}
executeTreatmentPatterns(
  cohorts = cohorts,
  cohortTableName = "cohort_table",
  outputPath = file.path(tempDir, "all-in-one"),
  connectionDetails = Eunomia::getEunomiaConnectionDetails(),
  cdmSchema = "main",
  resultSchema = "main",
  tempEmulationSchema = NULL,
  minEraDuration = 0,
  eraCollapseSize = 30,
  combinationWindow = 30,
  minCellCount = 5
)
```

## Evaluating output
Now that we have exported our output, in various ways, we can evaluate the output. As you may have noticed the `export` function exports 6 csv-files: **1**) treatmentPathways.csv, **2**) countsAge.csv, **3**) countsSex.csv, **4**) countsYear.csv, **5**) summaryStatsTherapyDuraion.csv, and **6**) metadata.csv

### treatmentPathways
The treatmentPathways file contains all the pathways found, with a frequency, pairwise stratified by age group, sex and index year.
```{r readTreatmentPathways}
treatmentPathways <- read.csv(file.path(tempDir, "default", "treatmentPathways.csv"))
head(treatmentPathways)
```

We are able to filter based on the strata, and filter on a frequency > 5.
```{r treatmentPathwaysAll}
all <- treatmentPathways %>%
  filter(
    age == "all",
    sex == "all",
    indexYear == "all",
    freq > 5
  )
```
We can see the pathways contain the treatment names we provided in our event cohorts. Besides that we also see the paths are annoted with a `+` or `-`. The `+` indicates two treatments are a combination therapy, i.e. `Acetaminophen+Amoxicillin` is a combination of _Acetaminophen_ and _Amoxicillin_. The `-` indicates a switch between treatments, i.e. `Aspirin-Acetaminophen` is a switch from _Aspirin_ to _Acetaminophen_. Note that these combinations and switches can occur in the same pathway, i.e. `Amoxicillin+Clavulanate-Aspirin`. The first treatment is a combination of _Amoxicillin_ and _Clavulanate_ that switches to _Aspirin_.

### countsAge, countsSex, and countsYear
The countsAge, countsSex, and countsYear contain counts per age, sex, and index year.
```{r counts}
age <- read.csv(file.path(tempDir, "default", "countsAge.csv"))
sex <- read.csv(file.path(tempDir, "default", "countsSex.csv"))
year <- read.csv(file.path(tempDir, "default", "countsYear.csv"))

head(age)
head(sex)
head(year)
```
### summaryStatsTherapyDuration
The summaryStatsTherapyDuration file contains some statistics pertaining combination and mono-therapies. Like the mean, median, minimum, and maximum durations. The standard deviation of durations, and the count of each treatment type.
```{r summaryStatsTherapyDuration}
read.csv(file.path(tempDir, "default", "summaryStatsTherapyDuration.csv"))
```


### metadata
The metadata file is a file that contains information about the circumstances the analysis was performed in, and information about R, and the CDM.
```{r metadata}
read.csv(file.path(tempDir, "default", "metadata.csv"))
```

### Sunburst Plot & Sankey Diagram
From the filtered treatmentPathways file we are able to create a sunburst plot.
```{r sunburstPlot}
createSunburstPlot(treatmentPathways = all, legend = list(w = 300))
```

Or a Sankey Diagram.
```{r sankeyDiagram}
createSankeyDiagram(all)
```

Both plots are interactive in an HTML-environment, and are easy to include in shiny applications.

```{r cleanup, include=FALSE}
# Remove temp files
unlink(tempDir, recursive = TRUE)

# Close Andromeda objects
Andromeda::close(defaultSettings)
Andromeda::close(minEra60)
Andromeda::close(splitAcuteTherapy)
Andromeda::close(includeEndDate)

# Close connection to CDM Reference
DBI::dbDisconnect(conn = con)
rm(defaultSettings, minEra60, splitAcuteTherapy, includeEndDate, con, cdm)
```
